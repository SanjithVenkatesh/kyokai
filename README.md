## Introduction and Goal
I have wanted to start doing data analytical projects with sumo data but have found it difficult to find data in a readable manner that can be read easily into Python programs. With this Python library we fetch data from the sumodb website and use string manipulation to create various Python objects to make it easy to generate sumo analysis.
